# Virulence and Transmission - Population Statistics

Use population data for death, positive cases, negative cases across the US to characterize
the virulence and transmissibility of SARS-CoV2. Suggestion to use 3 day average to smooth
data, working at the county level, correcting for testing discrepancies between counties
(see presentation on the impact of population density), correcting for social distancing
efficiencies have also been suggested.
